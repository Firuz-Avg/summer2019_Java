static: means that we can access the members through the class name
    
    static members belongs to the class, also called class members
    
    
what can be static in java:
            1. static variables
            2. static methods
            3. static initializer block
            4. static inner class (nested class)
            
instance variables: created in the class outside any method.
    belongs to the object. each object will have its own copy
    
local variables: declared within the methods or blocks
            only accessible within the method or block
            
            
static variables: created in the class outside any method with static keyword
    
           when a variable is static, it's shared by class and all objects of the class. and we can call
